* Added Local State to a Class
* State Updates 
* comparison operators
* what is [indexOf method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp)

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* I practiced REACT [HOOKS](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
*How to divide a task into several modules (so that the code is more readable and that one module does not have several functions)
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* you must enter the appropriate folder (command "cd" + file name)
* you must to install all packages via *npm install*
* then you can start *npm start*
